Sound and music technology is a multidisciplinary field. It involves science and technology subjects such as acoustics, audio signal processing, computer audition, machine learning, and music subjects such as composition, music production, sound engineering, sound design, device design etc. Sound and music technology has been developing in China since the 1990s. However, the progress is relatively slow due to various reasons. In December 2013, professors from Fudan University and Tsinghua University jointly established the first China Sound and Music Computing Workshop (CSMCW).

After three consecutive meetings held at Fudan University (2013), Tsinghua University (2014), and Shanghai Conservatory of Music (2015), CSMCW has become an important place for domestic colleagues for reunion and communication. In 2016, the fourth meeting was held at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and renamed as Conference on Sound and Music Technology (CSMT) to attract more artists, engineers and researchers,Sponsored by Shanghai Computer Music Association and undertaken by Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. For the first time, CSMT published its Chinese conference proceeding in Journal of Fudan University (Natural Science Edition). In 2017, the fifth conference was jointly hosted by Suzhou University and UCLA Advanced Technology Research Center, Suzhou. It also severed as a satellite event of ISMIR 2017. In 2018, the sixth conference was held at Xiamen University of Technology. For the first time, CSMT published its English conference proceeding with Springer LNEE. In 2019, the seventh conference was held at Harbin Institute of Technology. In 2020, the eighth conference was held at North University of China.In 2021, the Nineth conference was held at Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Conservatory of music. 

In June 2023, the Tenth Congress will be held in Xinghai Conservatory of Music and South China University of Technology. We hope it further accelerates the development of sound and music technology in China, and makes more contribution to this field.
