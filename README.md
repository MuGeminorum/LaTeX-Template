The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo (ICME) has been the flagship multimedia conference for the past two decades. Through the IEEE societies, the Conference serves as a forum to promote the latest advances in multimedia technologies, systems, and applications from both a research and development perspective.

ICME attracts well over 1000 submissions and 500 participants each year, serving as the prime forum for the dissemination of knowledge in the multimedia field. ICME 2023 will showcase high quality oral and poster presentations, as well as feature Workshops sponsored by IEEE societies. Researchers, developers and practitioners are welcomed to organise such Workshops on any new or emerging topic of Multimedia technology. An exposition of multimedia products, animations and industries will be held in conjunction with the conference. Moreover, proposals for Panels, Tutorials, Special Sessions, Industry Technology Workshops and Grand Challenges are also invited. In ICME 2023, exceptional papers and contributors will be also selected and recognised with prestigious awards.
