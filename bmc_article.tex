      In the interdisciplinary research field between music and computer, there are many research topics.
      They need data, however the datasets were scattered, hard to collect.
      Having many manual resources and many connections, we present a huge database contains datasets for numerous research topics in computer music.
      Such as .... for classical topic and some Chinese music-related datasets.
      Some for generic topics, some for Chienese-specific topics.
      We also present detailed evaluation of these datasets to show their validity.
      We hope this could benefit researchers who are strugling to find a dataset.

In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
%
\[
  E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]=
  \int_0^{v\wedge
    1}Z_0(uT_x)
  \exp (\lambda_1)\,du .
\]
%
If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqexpmuts}
  \begin{aligned}[b]
     & E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr]           \\
     & \quad      = \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
    \int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du .
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,xjon,marg,schn,koha,issnic}).
see \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Toghiani-RiziW17}.
